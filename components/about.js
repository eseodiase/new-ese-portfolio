          <p>
          I love using and building things with computer technology; I've had training as a graphics designer since I was a teenager. Sometime while working in Lagos, I tried creating a personal website for myself. The only way I could do that as an absolute beginner was by using a Content Managament Systems (CMS) such as WordPress.org or Wix.com. I really wanted some cool features added to my site, and in my quest to figure out how to get it done, I began my web development journey by learning HTML and CSS.

As of present, I have used various web technologies to build applications such as the Lyrics App, Restaurant Themes, Publisher Templates, Portfolio Themes, Weather App, Chessboard, Ludo Board, HTML Special Characters Library, etc.

I am currently learning Angular and NestJS to up my skills as a full stack developer.
